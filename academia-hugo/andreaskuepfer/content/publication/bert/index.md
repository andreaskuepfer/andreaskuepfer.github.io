abstract: "Political research on party politics and legislative behavior increasingly explores innovative data and methods to capture intra-party heterogeneity. Existing approaches are typically limited to estimating either legislators’ positions or their issue attention. In this research note, we present a new framework for the joint estimation of legislator-level position and salience scores from political text. We introduce a threestep approach that combines context-sensitive issue and position classifications via the supervised machine learning model BERT and the joint estimation of salience and positions via Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic models. Our framework is applicable to specific issues and issue sub-domains, to different types of formal and informal text, and to different languages. We scrutinize its performance under various amounts of manually annotated textual input through extensive validation checks and show that even with parsimonious manual annotations, our framework outperforms existing alternatives."

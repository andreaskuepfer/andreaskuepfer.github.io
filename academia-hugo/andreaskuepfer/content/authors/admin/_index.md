My work is centered around the analysis of multimodal political communication, encompassing various channels such as speeches, political advertisements and social media. To address significant questions in Political Science, I employ a combination of (multimodal) deep learning models and traditional methods, contributing to both substantial and methodological research. In addition, I am passionate about teaching and imparting knowledge to others. As a research associate at TU Darmstadt, I instruct various postgraduate courses focused on quantitative methods with a focus on text-driven methods. Substantively, my interests primarily lie in the areas of political communication and legislative studies, which I believe are critical for understanding the complexities of modern political structures and discourse. As a team member of the [Social Science Data Lab Blog](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/) based at the [Mannheim Center for European Social Research (MZES)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/), I do both, supporting the organization and implementation of workshops as well as contributing blog posts and input talks.

I'm happy to connect with you either via [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ankuepfer.bsky.social), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ankuepfer) or by [email](mailto:andreas.kuepfer@tu-darmstadt.de).

Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute for Political Science of the <a href="https://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/institut/personen_pw/kuepfer_andreas/andreas_kuepfer_inhalt.en.jsp" target="_blank">Technical University of Darmstadt</a>, working at the intersection of Data Science and Political Science. Before that, I graduated from the University of Mannheim with a Master degree in Data Science. My work is centered around analyzing multimodal political communication, encompassing various channels such as parliamentary speeches, political advertisements, and social media.

To address significant questions in Political Science, I employ a combination of (multimodal) deep learning models and traditional methods, contributing to both substantial and methodological research. In addition, I'm passionate about teaching and imparting knowledge to others. I instruct various postgraduate courses focused on quantitative methods with a focus on Computational Social Science. Substantively, my interests primarily lie in the area of legislative debates, which I believe are critical for understanding the complexities of modern political structures. I'm part of the organizational team of the [Social Science Data Lab](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/) ([Mannheim Center for European Social Research (MZES)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/)).

I'm happy to connect with you either via [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ankuepfer.bsky.social) or by [email](mailto:andreas.kuepfer@tu-darmstadt.de).

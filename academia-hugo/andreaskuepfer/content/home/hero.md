## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate and Research Associate at the Institute for Political Science of the <a href="https://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/institut/personen_pw/kuepfer_andreas/andreas_kuepfer_inhalt.en.jsp" target="_blank">Technical University of Darmstadt</a> working at the intersection of Data Science and Political Science. Before that, I graduated from the University of Mannheim with a Master degree in Data Science. My work is centered around the analysis of multimodal political communication, encompassing various channels such as parliamentary speeches, political advertisements and social media.

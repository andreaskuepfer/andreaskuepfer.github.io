## Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate and Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/institut/personen_pw/kuepfer_andreas/andreas_kuepfer_inhalt.en.jsp" target="_blank">Technical University of Darmstadt</a> (since 05/2022) working at the intersection of Data Science and Political Science. Before that, I graduated from the University of Mannheim with a Master degree in Data Science. As a team member of the [Social Science Data Lab Blog](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/) based at the [Mannheim Center for European Social Research (MZES)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/), I do both, supporting the organization and implementation of workshops as well as contributing blog posts and input talks.

Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate and Research Associate at the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/institut/personen_pw/kuepfer_andreas/andreas_kuepfer_inhalt.en.jsp) (since 05/2022) working at the intersection of Data Science and Political Science. Before that, I pursued a Masters degree in Data Science at the University of Mannheim. As a team member of the [Social Science Data Lab Blog](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/) based at the [Mannheim Center for European Social Research (MZES)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/) I do both, supporting the organization and implementation of workshops as well as contributing blog posts and input talks.

I do enjoy working with all forms of political texts (e.g. social media, speeches, or press releases) having the goal to deepen the understanding of them. During my Master thesis I developed a framework to estimate legislator-level salience and position estimates based on political text using Transformers. Starting in Fall 2022 I am going to hold a Masters course at TU Darmstadt providing an introduction to R and methods interesting for political scientists. My substantial interests focus on political communication and intra-party heterogeneity.
